# Financial Scripting Algos 

Automated standard financial (scripting) modeling via Python.

A lot of standard financial modeling takes a ton of time and most is time wasted.  VBA macros are bloated and insecure.  If you travel or need to share models the cloud is more secure and extensible than XCL or VBA.  Much easier to extend code than spreadsheets.  

Sharing the first bits if anyone wants to fork it.  Basically upload your financial model to your Google Docs and use this to do things you might normally do via Shift+F9s or iterative modeling in XCL.  Or specify a simple model/function and use this to automate then copy/paste output to your local XCL. 

Current capabilities:
* Sensitivity tables

Need to clean up before sharing:
* Time series functions
* Extreme value analysis
* Dynamic graphing
